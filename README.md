# WebDrink 2.0

A rewrite of the web interface for [Drink](http://csh.rit.edu/projects.php), the networked vending machines on Computer Science House. It can be used for managing inventory, applying credits, dropping drinks, and more. It includes an updated, mobile-friendly interface and an API for easily creating new Drink clients. 

Based on the original [WebDrink](https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/WebDrink). Uses [Drink-JS](https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/Drink-JS) to communicate with the Drink hardware.

WebDrink 2.0 is now LIVE (for all CSHers)! Check it out at https://webdrink.csh.rit.edu!

Check out the [API Documentation](docs/API.md) and develop your own Drink clients!

__Why Update WebDrink?__
* Address usability concerns (make it mobile friendly, improve the admin experience, etc)    
* Expose an API to improve current/future development (mobile apps, new new WebDrink, etc)
* Learning, I guess (Angular, RESTful API, etc)

__It Uses:__
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)    
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)    
* [A RESTful API](http://coreymaynard.com/blog/creating-a-restful-api-with-php/)    
* Boring ol' PHP
