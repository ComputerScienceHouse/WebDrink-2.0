WebDrink 2.0
============

Rewrite of CSH WebDrink. Includes updated interface and new API.

CSH-Public Demo: https://members.csh.rit.edu/~bencentra/webdrink/

Why?
* Address usability concerns (make it mobile friendly, improve admin experience, etc)    
* Make improved API for current/future development (mobile apps, new new webdrink, etc)
* Learning, I guess (Angular, RESTful API, etc)

It Uses:
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)    
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)    
* [A RESTful API](http://coreymaynard.com/blog/creating-a-restful-api-with-php/)    
* Boring ol' PHP        

The project is still in active development. Let me know (via email or GitHub issue) of any feature requests or glaring implementation/security issues.
